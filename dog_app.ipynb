    "__Answer:__ Having a look at many images (and also considering the accuracies of the dog and face detector given above), our algorithm sometimes fails to see that there is a dog or human in an image. Also the dog with glasses (have a look at the outputs below) is mistakenly classified as a bulldog. I am not an expert on dog breeds, but I do not think this is right.\n",

    "Three suggestions to improve the algorithm:\n",
    "- To detect human faces it might be more accurate to also train a CNN (or use a pretrained network) than using a Haar feature-based cascade classifier.\n",
    "- The training images generator could also randomly occlude parts of the images to be able to find more features to detect a dog breed (and thus also be able to classify a dog when it wears glasses e.g.)\n",
    "- The algorithm will give strange outputs when we use an image with multiple dogs, or dog and human as an input. We could try to at least give a warning message if this is the case."
